# JAVA-SCRIPT-SERIES

DAY-1
Topics Covered :

1.Hoisting in java script.
 Hoisting is JavaScript's default behavior of moving declarations to the top.
 
2.Operators in java script.
 
Arithmetic operators are symbols that perform mathematical operations 
on numbers.
 
 +:Addition
 
 -:Subtraction
  
 *****:Multiplication
   
 /:Division
 
 %:Remainder


Comparison operators compare values and return a Boolean value of true or false.

 == Checks if two operands are equal 
 
 != Checks if two operands are not equal 
 
 <: Checks if the left operand is less than the right operand 
 
 >: Checks if the left operand is greater than the right operand

 <= Checks if the left operand is less than or equal to the right operand 
 
 >= Checks if the left operand is greater than or equal to the right operand


DAY-2
Topics Covered :

1.The Increment Operator (++)
 The increment operator (++) adds 1 from the operand.
 If it is placed after the operand, it returns the value before the increment.
 If it is placed before the operand, it returns the value after the increment.

2.The Decrement Operator (--)
 The decrement operator (--) subtracts 1 to the operand.
 If it is placed after the operand, it returns the value before the decrement.
 If it is placed before the operand, it returns the value after the decrement.
 
3.Logical Operators
 Operator Description
 && and
 || or
 ! not

 

Day 3



Topics Covered :

1.Decision Making

 Decision Making in programming is needed to make the logical decision for        doing some operation.



if statement: It is used if some statement has to be executed based on single condition. It is used to decide whether a certain statement or block of statements will be executed or not i.e. if a certain condition is true then the block of statement is executed otherwise not.



if-else statement: It is used when some set of code has to be executed based on some given conditions otherwise another set of code has to be executed. The if statement alone tells us that if a condition is true it will execute a block of statements and if the condition is false then else block executed. We can use the else statement with if statement to execute a block of code when the condition is false.



switch-Statement: It is used when multiple condition has to be evaluated based on single variable expression.



2.prompt() method

The prompt() method displays a dialog box that prompts the user for input.

Day 4

Topics Covered :

1. JavaScript Loops

Loops are handy, if you want to run the same code over and over again, each time with a different value.

Often this is the case when working with arrays:

for - loops through a block of code a number of times

for/in - loops through the properties of an object

while - loops through a block of code while a specified condition is true

do/while - also loops through a block of code while a specified condition is true

Day 7

Topics Covered :

1.JavaScript Functions

A JavaScript function is a block of code designed to perform a particular task.
A JavaScript function is executed when "something" invokes it (calls it).

. Arrow Functions

 Arrow functions were introduced in ES6.
 Arrow functions allow us to write shorter function syntax:

. Regular Functions

 Regular functions in JavaScript are defined using the function keyword and 
 can be named or anonymous. They have their own this context, which 
 varies depending on how they‚Äôre called, and they also have access to 
 the arguments object for handling passed parameters.

. Function Expression

 A function expression is a way to define a function as part of an expression 
 making it versatile for assigning to variables, passing as arguments, or 
 invoking immediately.

2.Alerts

 The alert() method displays an alert box with a message and an OK button.
 The alert() method is used when you want information to come through to 
 the user.

3.Parameters And Arguments

 Function parameters are the names listed in the function definition.
 Function arguments are the real values passed to (and received by) the 
 function.

 Day 8

Topics Covered :

1. JavaScript Objects

   Objects are variables too. But objects can contain many values.
 
2. spread operator

   The spread operator in JavaScript is a syntax introduced in ECMAScript 6 
   (ES6) that allows you to spread the elements of an iterable (such as arrays, 
   strings, or objects), into another iterable or function call. It is denoted by 
   three dots ‚Äú ... ‚Äù

Day 9

Topics Covered :

1. Map Object Methods and Properties

 * has(value) ‚Äì Checks if a Set contains a specific value
   
 * delete(value) ‚Äì Removes a specific value from a Set
   
 * clear() ‚Äì Removes all items from a Set
   
 * keys() ‚Äì Returns all values in a Set
   
 * values() ‚Äì Returns all values in a Set
   
 * entries() ‚Äì Returns all values in a Set as [value, value] array
   
 * size ‚Äì Returns the number of items in Set

   ‚úÖ Day 10

 Topic Covered :
 
 Document Object Model (DOM)
 
 The Document Object Model (DOM) is a programming interface that allows 
 JavaScript to interact with HTML documents. The DOM represents a web 
 page as a tree structure, with each branch ending in a node that contains 
 objects.
